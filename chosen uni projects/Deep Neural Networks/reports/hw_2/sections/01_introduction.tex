% \subsection{Task Overview}
% The objective of this assignment consists of two parts. The first part involves implementing Grad-CAM \cite{gradcam} to produce visual explanations for the decisions of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The second part aims to design an automated pipeline for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) \cite{sam}, utilizing the outputs from Grad-CAM to generate prompt points without user intervention.

% \subsection{Dataset}
% We will use a small custom dataset based on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10}{CIFAR-10}, but containing images with one of five objects (circle, square, diamond, triangle, star), with ground-truth segmentations of that object. The dataset was split into training (3500 images), validation (1000 images), and test (500 images) sets.
